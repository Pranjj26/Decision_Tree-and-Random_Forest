# Decision Tree and Random Forest Project README

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of Decision Trees and Random Forest, two powerful machine learning algorithms, using Python and popular data science libraries. Decision Trees are versatile algorithms used for both classification and regression tasks, while Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy. In this project, we use a dataset from loan data to predict whether a borrower will not fully pay back a loan based on various features, such as FICO score, interest rate, loan purpose, and more.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code in this project, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python (3.x recommended)
- Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE
- Required Python libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Project Structure

- `Decision_Tree_and_Random_Forest_Project.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code and explanations for the Decision Tree and Random Forest analysis.
- `loan_data.csv`: CSV file containing the dataset used for analysis.

## Installation

1. Clone or download this project repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`Decision_Tree_and_Random_Forest_Project.ipynb`) using your preferred Python IDE or Jupyter Notebook itself.
3. Ensure you have the dataset file named `loan_data.csv` in the same directory as the notebook.

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run each cell step by step to follow the Decision Tree and Random Forest analysis process.
2. The notebook contains detailed comments and explanations for each code cell to help you understand the workflow.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

We start by exploring the dataset to gain insights into its structure and contents:

- Loading the dataset using Pandas.
- Displaying basic statistics and information about the data.
- Visualizing data distributions, histograms, and relationships between variables.

## Data Preparation

We prepare the data for modeling:

- Encoding categorical features using one-hot encoding.
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets using `train_test_split` from scikit-learn.

## Decision Tree Model

The project involves training and evaluating a Decision Tree classifier:

- Creating a Decision Tree classifier using `DecisionTreeClassifier` from scikit-learn.
- Fitting the model to the training data.
- Making predictions using the test data.
- Generating a classification report and a confusion matrix to evaluate the Decision Tree model's performance.

## Random Forest Model

We also train and evaluate a Random Forest classifier:

- Creating a Random Forest classifier using `RandomForestClassifier` from scikit-learn with a specified number of estimators (trees).
- Fitting the model to the training data.
- Making predictions using the test data.
- Generating a classification report and a confusion matrix to evaluate the Random Forest model's performance.
